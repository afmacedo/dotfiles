Home directory
==============

This exists to provide my command line essentials.

As of now it is focused on OS X but I have plans to make it autoadaptable to

I claim no credit but would like to thank Ross and those before him
for the inspiration and code: 
[Ross's `dotfiles`](https://github.com/rozza/dotfiles).
